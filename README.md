# goblin-dreams
This project is an attempt to create a procedural goblin fantasy world generator and simulator. By simulating the lives of individual goblins, hopefully a rich and detailed history of the world can be generated super super slowly.

Parts:\
  world gen: (world.py)\
  country + settlement gen: (no file yet)\
  goblin gen: (no file yet)\
